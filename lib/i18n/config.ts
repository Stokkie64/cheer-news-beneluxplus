 * The site is small (~10 routes), mostly Server Components, and the Firestore
 * DATA stays Dutch regardless of UI language, so locale-prefixed routes would
 * add restructuring for no gain. The chosen locale lives in a cookie; the root
 * layout reads it server-side so SSR renders the right language with no flash.
